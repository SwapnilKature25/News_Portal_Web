        <p>'Hera Pheri 3' shooting begins with Akshay Kumar, Suniel Shetty...</p>

            It's all happening out there on the 'Hera Pheri 3' front. So much so that Firoz Nadiadwala has even started shooting for it. Ssshh! The shoot has begun so quietly at Mumbai's Empire Studio (owned by Firoz) that it might not have been so quick to come out in the open, had it not been the alacrity of ETimes. Akshay Kumar, Suniel Shetty and Paresh Rawal have taken stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember you read it here FIRST & EXCLUSIVE. We are also telling you that Anees Bazmee is not directing 'Hera Pheri 3'. It's Farhad Samji, who broke away from Firoz's cousin Sajid Nadiadwala in the Salman Khan starrer 'Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan'. While Salman is very much still in the film and in fact decided to produce it, Sajid Nadiadwala chose to take a step back. We had broken that story to you FIRST and EXCLUSIVE. In case you missed it, read it below:
          Kartik Aaryan is not doing the film. Reportedly, he had been approached for it. It was being said that he would reprise Akshay's part. Later, Suniel Shetty said that there had probably been some hera-pheri in casting but he was not aware how it all happened. We guess, Firoz and Suniel both must be responsible for getting Akshay back.
